## Md Abdul Kadir – Short Bio

Md Abdul Kadir is a researcher at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), based at the Saarland Informatics Campus in Saarbrücken, Germany[^2][^3][^4]. His work centers on deep learning, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), and interactive machine learning, with a particular focus on applications in healthcare and computer vision[^2][^4][^5].

Kadir holds a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Saarland University, where he specialized in machine learning, data science, and image processing[^3][^4]. He has been affiliated with DFKI since 2019, contributing to the Interactive Machine Learning department[^1][^4]. His research has received international recognition, including the Best Paper Award at the CD-MAKE 2021 conference for his work on explainable AI in medical imaging[^5].

Kadir’s recent publications address topics such as harmonizing feature attributions across deep learning architectures and the application of machine learning to scanpath analysis for gaze-based interaction[^7]. He collaborates closely with leading researchers in the field and is supervised by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Daniel Sonntag[^4][^5].
